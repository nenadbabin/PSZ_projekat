# Real Estate Market in Serbia (Data Mining and Semantic Web course project)

Data science project involving web scraping, database creation, data analysis, visualization, and implementation of machine learning algorithms.

Key Components:

1. **Data Collection**: The project involves developing a web crawler and scraper to gather real estate data from Serbian websites, aiming to build a database with at least 20,000 property records.

2. **Data Analysis**: Analytical tasks include listing properties by sale and rent status, categorizing by city, differentiating registered and unregistered properties, and generating top lists based on various criteria.

3. **Data Visualization**: This involves creating visual representations of data such as property distribution in Belgrade, categorization by size and construction decade, and sale vs. rent comparisons in top cities.

4. **Regression Implementation**: A part of the project includes developing an application that uses linear regression to predict apartment prices in Belgrade based on various attributes a user selects.

5. **Classification Implementation**: Implementing a K-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) algorithm for classifying property prices into different categories based on the attributes a user selects.
